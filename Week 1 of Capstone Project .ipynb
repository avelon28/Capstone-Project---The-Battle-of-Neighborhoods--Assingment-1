This means that the National Health Service (NHS) is overwhelmed with patients, not enough staff, hence causing a risk for the family or friends who live with the healthcare workers. Therefore, the idea is to find a location for temporary accomodation nearby hospitals in London for healthcare workers when they are COVID positive, so they can minimize the risk of exposing COVID to their family or friends who live with them. Therefore, the target audience for this project is the healthcare workers, and patients who are positive for COVID.
